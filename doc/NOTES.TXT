= The usage of Monitor vs Thread.Mutex


From what I read[1], ruby's Mutex isn't a fully reantrant mutex[2]. Because the thread management is outsourcedto the eventmachine library, there is no guarantee which thread will run what. Monitor is reentrant so, is mandatory to use it. The error that promoted this research was:

ruby `synchronize': "thread tried to join itself (ThreadError)"
